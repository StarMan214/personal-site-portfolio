      <strong>JAVA</strong> Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. 
			It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many 
			services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
            While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many applications and even some websites 
			that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for 
			their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. Java can be simplified as an object-oriented programming language that makes 
			the job of coding for developers and programmers easier. It can be used to build applications and install it in a cross-platform setting. For the purpose 
			of development of applications, Java technology is the most widely used software platform today whether it be client-side or server-side.
